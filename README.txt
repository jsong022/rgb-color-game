A simple game based on RGB colors

Made as a practice for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

- Presents a color in RGB format in the Heading.
- Presents 6 Squares with different colors to guess from.
- User clicks on a Square to guess that color.
- If the color is the one represented by the RGB given:
	the Result shows "correct" & all Squares change to that color
- If the color guessed is not the one represented by the RGB given:
	the Result shows "try again" & chosen Square turns "invisible" 
- The set of color choices, the target color, and the "corrct" Square
	are all randomized.

To Add:
- Make it look pretty (get some CSS & Bootstrap practice)
- Add different difficulties (more/less choices to choose from)
