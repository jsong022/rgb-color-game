A simple game based on RGB colors

Made as a practice for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

- Presents a color in RGB format in the Heading.
- Presents 6 Squares with different colors to guess from.
- User clicks on a Square to guess that color.
- If the color is the one represented by the RGB given:
	the Result shows "correct" & all Squares change to that color
- If the color guessed is not the one represented by the RGB given:
	the Result shows "try again" & chosen Square turns "invisible" 
- The set of color choices, the target color, and the "corrct" Square
	are all randomized.
- New Game button's text changes upon winning
- 3 Difficulty settings (Easy/Normal/Hard)
	Easy: 3 choices
	Normal: 6 Choices
	Hard: 9 Choices
- Made it not an eyesore using some CSS
- Added some simple fade animations to the game
